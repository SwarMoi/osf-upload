```{R}
# Generate a PAT (Personal Access Token) from your OSF account and paste it here.
# OSF settings => Personal Access Token (Create Token)
Token = "Paste your PAT here"

# Authenticate
osf_auth(Token)

# project url id / GUID (global unique identifier)
# eg. for Savant OSF Project https://osf.io/feh9r/ => url_id/GUID/node = "feh9r" | N.B GUID would always be a 5 alphanummeric sting

GUID = "xxxxx"

# retrive project node
project <- osf_retrieve_node(GUID)
```


```{R}
# OSF Upload
# osf_upload(node,"filepath/to/local/machine") 
# If there exists subfolders use recurse = TRUE or recurse = X, where X is a postive number denoting subfolder levels
# You can also use progress = TRUE, which will show a progress bar for files upload
# NB in case of recursive folders, OSFr will first create a the folder structures and then populate/upload the files.

osf_upload(project,"filepath/to/local/machine", recurse = TRUE, progress = TRUE)

# If you want to upload your working directory then use this 
# osf_upload(project, ".", recurse = TRUE, progress = TRUE)
